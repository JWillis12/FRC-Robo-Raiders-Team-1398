# FRC Robo-Raiders (Team 1398)

In the nine years since the Robo-Raiders of FIRST Team 1398 completed their rookie season, our team has expanded our focus from the performance of our robots to inspiring others to have an interest in robotics and engineering. During this time, our focus has never wavered from our commitment to change the culture within ourselves, our school, and our community to hold science and technology in greater esteem. In all of our endeavors, FIRST Team 1398 has maintained its vision for a more informed society by devising an action plan and relentlessly pursuing our strategies to achieve a cultural revolution.
